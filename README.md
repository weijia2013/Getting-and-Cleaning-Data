Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
========================================================================

This repository's contents are all my own work. It provides my personal solustions for the Coursera course named: Getting-and-Cleaning-Data.

Learning curve is very steep for R beginners for taking this course. Quizzes are fairly challenging. However, I still strongly recommend you do the quiz and project by yourself. If you've spent more than a few hours on the quizzes, I suggest you can have a break and clear your head. If you still can't figure them out, code in this rerepository might be help you in somewhat. 

## Note:
The code of quiz1 to quiz4 and the GCD folder need to be at the same working directory.
