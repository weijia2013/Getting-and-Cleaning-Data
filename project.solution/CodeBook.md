This is the CodeBook of Getting-and-Cleaning-Data Projetc. This file explains the meanings of each object and variables. How the scripts work can be found at README.md file.
This file infludes two sections:

1. Object names and meanings
2. Variable names and meanings

# Object names and meanings

The following table explains all the objects and the reasons to name them.

| Object name           |          Meanings                                                          |

| 2. `tidydatamean`     | The result of grouped data frame by volunteer and activity and rest variables' mean are stored to it |


# Variables names and meanings

The following table explains all the objects and the reasons to name them.

| Object name           |          Meanings                                                          |
| --------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| 1. `volunteer`        | In the research, subject means volunteer                                   |
| 2. `activity`         | In the research, the purpose is to identify volunteers' activities         |
